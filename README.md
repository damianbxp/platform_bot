# Omnidirectional Platform Robot Project

## Description
This project focuses on developing an omnidirectional platform robot equipped with mecanum wheels, allowing it to move in all directions and spin in place. The control system for the robot is implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS), while simulation is conducted using the Gazebo simulator. The project aims to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of omnidirectional movement in robotics and provide a platform for experimentation and development in ROS-based robotics projects.

## Features
- Omnidirectional movement capability using mecanum wheels.
- ROS-based control system for the robot.
- Integration with Gazebo simulator for robot and environment simulation.
- Ability to simulate various environments and scenarios for testing and development.
- Modular design for easy customization and expansion of robot functionalities.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have ROS installed on your system. If not, follow the installation instructions provided on the official ROS website.
2. Install the Gazebo simulator according to the instructions provided on the official Gazebo website.
3. Clone or download this repository to your ROS workspace.
4. Build the ROS packages included in the repository using `colcon`.
5. Launch the Gazebo simulation environment with the robot model using the provided launch files.
6. Explore the ROS topics, messages, and services for controlling the robot's movement and accessing sensor data.
7. Experiment with different control algorithms and navigation strategies to achieve desired robot behavior.
